# Dody's THAW IMG.WPC Converter
My first ever coded program lol, Converts DXT1 DDS (Pictures, textures, anything) files to IMG.WPCs for use with Tony Hawk's American Wasteland (PC version)

REQUIRES NODE.JS TO WORK / YOU NEED TO VERTICALLY FLIP YOUR DDS PICTURE BEFOREHAND AND SAVE IT AS DDS FLIPPING ISN'T IMPLEMENTED (yet)

# Usage
1. Clone the repository and run the script via Command Prompt or anything similar that does the job
2. Available commands: [input.dds] [output.img.wpc]

# Examples
node Converter.js test.dds test.img.wpc / node Converter.js wallpaper.dds loadscrn_east_la.img.wpc

Tested with a 4K (3840x2160) DXT1 DDS (Previously converted from PNG via paint.net) wallpaper as a loading screen for a level

And another 8K (7680x4320) DXT1 DDS (Previously converted from JPG via paint.net) wallpaper as a loading screen for a level

**Also this doesn't mean you go haywire and convert everything you see that is above 8K**
