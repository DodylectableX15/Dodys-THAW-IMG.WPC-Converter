# Dody's THAW IMG.WPC Converter
My first ever coded program lol, Converts DXT1 DDS (Pictures, textures, anything) files to IMG.WPCs for use with Tony Hawk's American Wasteland (PC version)

REQUIRES NODE.JS TO WORK / YOU NEED TO VERTICALLY FLIP YOUR DDS PICTURE BEFOREHAND AND SAVE IT AS DDS FLIPPING ISN'T IMPLEMENTED (yet)

# Usage
1. Clone the repository and run the script via Command Prompt or anything similar that does the job
2. Available commands: [input.dds] [output.img.wpc]

# Examples
node Converter.js test.dds test.img.wpc / node Converter.js wallpaper.dds loadscrn_east_la.img.wpc

Tested with a 4K (3840x2160) DXT1 DDS wallpaper as a loading screen for a level
